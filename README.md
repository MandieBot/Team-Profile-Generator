# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that gathers information about employees, then generates a dynamic HTML page displaying summaries for each person on a card. Building this application also heavily involved Test Driven Development to ensure the code was functioning as expected. Jest was used for running these tests and Inquirer was implemented for collecting user input from the prompted questions.
